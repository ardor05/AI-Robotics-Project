The task of this project is to create robot exploration behaviour that requires the robot to 
continuously move forward and avoid the obstacles. 
The robot will keep exploring the area by following the wall near it. 
The robot used for this project is equipped with Ligt Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors.
